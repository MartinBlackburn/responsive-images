#Responsive images

This is a test for loading different images with javascript, based on screen width.

##How it works
Include the responsiveImages.js, then set it up using the following.  

<div data-image-500=""></div>

The number after the data-image- is at what size (or bigger) the image should be used.  
You can use multiple data-image-<size> and only the biggest image will be loaded.
